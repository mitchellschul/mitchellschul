### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

####  I am in my forth and final year at Michigan State University studying information science with a focus in human-centered technology, and a minor in computer science. I have always had a passion for learning new technologies and how they can help improve the daily life. My main interests include web and mobile design, artificial intelligence, graphic design, and data visualization.
